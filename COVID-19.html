            Human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. They were isolated using two different methods in the United Kingdom and the United States.<br>

            The first two cases in Ghana were confirmed on 12 March 2020, when two infected people came to Ghana, one from Norway and the other from Turkey.
            <br>
            Initially the Government of Ghana banned all public gatherings including conferences, workshops, funerals, festivals, political rallies, church activities and other related events to reduce the spread of the virus. Beaches were also closed. Basic schools, senior high schools and universities, both public and private, were also closed. Only BECE and WASSCE candidates were permitted to remain in school under social distancing protocols.
    
    Traveling to Ghana from countries which had recorded over 200 positive COVID-19 cases was strongly discouraged with non-admittance of such travellers; this restriction did not however apply to Ghanaian citizens and people with resident permits.
    
     <br> 
    <br> All of the country's borders were later closed for two weeks from midnight of Sunday 22 March 2020. Passport services were also suspended.
    
    On 30 March, the partial lock down of Accra and Kumasi took effect. Members of the Executive, Legislature and the Judiciary; and some services such as those that were involved in the production, distribution and marketing of food, beverages, pharmaceuticals, medicine, paper and plastic packages, media and telecommunications were exempted from the restrictions
